# Predelayed Stabilization in Quantum Measurement

This repository presents an open, phenomenological hypothesis concerning the temporal structure of quantum measurement outcome stabilization.

The work is structured in three layers:
1. **Core preprint** – a concise, test-oriented scientific note.
2. **Expanded notes** – additional conceptual clarification and motivation.
3. **Russian supplement** – an informal explanatory text describing the underlying intuition.

The hypothesis does **not** modify quantum mechanics and is fully compatible with standard quantum predictions at final measurement.
