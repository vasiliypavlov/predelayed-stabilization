## Abstract
We propose a phenomenological hypothesis in which quantum measurement outcomes are not fixed instantaneously, but emerge through a short-lived stabilization process involving competing phase-consistent evolutions. Prior to final outcome fixation, transient correlations between alternative phase paths may exist. A feasible interferometric experiment based on weak measurements is outlined that could distinguish this hypothesis from standard interpretations of quantum mechanics. The proposal does not modify the quantum formalism and is compatible with standard quantum predictions at final detection.

## Disclaimer
This work does **not** propose a modification of quantum mechanics, nor an alternative formalism.  
It introduces a phenomenological hypothesis concerning the temporal structure of outcome stabilization during quantum measurement, fully compatible with standard quantum predictions at the level of final measurement statistics.

## 1. Introduction
Quantum mechanics provides accurate statistical predictions, yet the physical nature of measurement outcome selection remains interpretationally ambiguous. In standard formulations, outcome fixation is typically assumed to occur instantaneously (collapse), is attributed to environmental decoherence, or is interpreted as branch differentiation without privileged selection.

This work explores a conservative alternative viewpoint: outcome fixation may occur through a finite-time stabilization process involving multiple competing phase-consistent evolutions. The hypothesis concerns the internal temporal structure of measurement prior to final detection and does not alter observable post-measurement statistics.

## 2. Phenomenological Hypothesis
We consider a quantum system prepared in a superposition of distinguishable outcomes and posit:

1. Prior to final detection, multiple phase-consistent evolution paths coexist.
2. These paths may exhibit weak mutual correlations mediated by system–environment coupling.
3. Outcome fixation corresponds to the stabilization of one phase-consistent ensemble over others.

Asymmetry between outcomes is not assumed to be primary but is taken to emerge dynamically.

## 3. Testable Consequence
If outcome stabilization is a finite-time process, the system may exhibit, prior to final detection:

- Weak but non-zero correlations between alternative phase paths.
- Dependence of these correlations on the delay before detection.
- Saturation or decay of correlations once stabilization completes.

Such effects are not explicitly predicted by models assuming instantaneous outcome fixation.

## 4. Proposed Experiment

### 4.1 System
A Mach–Zehnder interferometer with single-photon input.

### 4.2 Measurement Scheme
Weak phase measurements are introduced independently in both interferometer arms. Final photon detection is delayed via an adjustable optical path.

### 4.3 Observable
Let $` \phi_A(t) `$ and $` \phi_B(t) `$ denote weak phase estimates in arms A and B. Define the correlation function:

```math
C(t) = \langle \phi_A(t)\phi_B(t) \rangle - \langle \phi_A(t) \rangle \langle \phi_B(t) \rangle.
```

### 4.4 Predictions
- **Standard quantum mechanics:** correlations fully accounted for by wavefunction statistics and measurement backaction.
- **Predelayed stabilization hypothesis:** transient non-zero correlations with characteristic time dependence prior to detection.

---

## 5. Relation to Existing Interpretations
- **Copenhagen-type interpretations:** assume instantaneous outcome selection.
- **Decoherence-based approaches:** suppress interference but do not specify outcome selection dynamics.
- **Many-worlds interpretations:** allow coexistence of branches without privileged stabilization.

The present hypothesis differs by positing a finite-time stabilization process prior to outcome fixation.

---

## 6. Scope and Limitations
This hypothesis is phenomenological and falsifiable. Absence of the predicted correlations would rule out the proposed stabilization dynamics.

---

## 7. Conclusion
Quantum measurement outcomes may arise through a finite-time stabilization process among competing phase-consistent evolutions. Weak-measurement interferometry provides a realistic experimental route to probe this possibility within existing laboratory capabilities.
